# REDUCING-COST-IN-SEMICONDUCTOR-MANUFACTURING-USING-AI-
 This project  investigates the application of AI in key areas of semiconductor manufacturing, focusing on defect  detection, predictive maintenance, process optimization, and 
 dynamic power management.
 Our study demonstrates how AI techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
 reinforcement learning, can achieve substantial cost savings by reducing waste, improving production
 efficiency, and minimizing the need for energy-intensive processes. The results suggest that integrating AI
 into semiconductor manufacturing workflows not only drives down costs and enhances energy efficiency
 but also supports sustainable production practices. As AI continues to evolve, its role in semiconductor
 manufacturing is poised to expand, setting new standards for cost-effective and environmentally friendly
 chip design and production.
